Constructor in Python is a special function that runs automatically when you create an object of a class.

```text
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        print("A dog is born!")

Creating object
d = Dog()          # This will print: A dog is born!

```
__init__ is dunder methods that are predefined in python

It is method that object can't call, it called automatically at certain criteria

What is benefit of it?

Constructor is thing that user can't controll

Constructor is special method and yaha pe aap wo code likhte ho jo app application ke shuru hote hi, 
user ko bina puchhe hi execute karna chahte ho, jo aapko application run karne me help karta hai

jaise database se connectivity, internet se connectivity, gps se connectivity, hardware se connectivity
ya koi bhi configuration related task

Philosophy

Agar duniya ek class hai, God ek programmer hai, to constructor ke ander kya aayega?

matlab duniya agar class hai to iska object ham humans hai, to constructor hoga - death

jaise hi object bana matlab mai paida hua, ek chij decide ho gai ki mai marunga, aur ye mere hat nahi nai, ye automatically hoga
